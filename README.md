Chicago and the state of illinois has readily available data on lobbying efforts and political donations. All though available, the processes in place to track these activities allow for ambiguity due to an over whelming amount of data that is segmented and an lobbyist (firm and individuals) ability to continue to register new accounts for each activity.

Needs:

Assemble the various data sources to building a singular data set with common profiles that connects the individual and organization with the elected official and the activity type/subject.

Apply AI and other technologies to analyze the data and drive insight.

Display data via profile of individual, organizations, activity type, geographically(physical and political)
